        <div class="background container" >My name is Eternity Hunter, and this is my resume website. Here you can find my skills, projects and more. I am an enthusiastic and	motivated high school senior(GPA: 4.3) with a love for coding and music. I have had the pleasure to be in band for six years, playing a wide variety of instruments such as the clarinet(main instrument), tenor saxophone, and piano. My senior year of high school I was drum major, and I experienced the value of team-work, and purpose. This is my first website and I am super excited to show my skills and my hard-work.  </div>
